<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p class="section">
	In this paper we propose Henry, a software developer. Our benchmarks find that Henry is a 
	fantastic programmer and a joy to work with. Disclaimer: These conclusions may be slightly biased.

<h4>1 Introduction</h4>
<p class="section">
	Henry greatly enjoys performance-oriented programming. He started making games in 2011, which
	led to interests in real-time constrained fields such as physics simulation and graphics. 
	Nearing the completion of his degree, given his skillset and affinity for money, he naturally 
	gravitated towards a position in high-frequency trading (HFT).
</p>

<br>
<h4>2 Previous Work</h4>
<p class="section">
	Henry has been working at Tradebot, one of the oldest HFT firms, since June 2022. He spends 
	most of his time building out the company's C++ research infrastructure, and is open to 
	further inquiries about this experience. [<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrywilliamsdev/">LinkedIn</a>]

<h4>3 Starboard</h4>
<p class="section">
	Starboard is a large open-world multiplayer game that has been developed casually over nearly 
	8 years using Unity/C#. It was officially "postponed" in 2023 but is secretly still being 
	worked on. Because Henry is tired of writing about himself in the third person, this 
	paper will henceforth be written in the first person.

<h4>3.1 Procedural Animation</h4>
<p class="section">
	Trying to code natural movement for creatures is a lot of fun. This crab, for example, uses 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics">inverse kinematics</a> to calculate 
	leg transformations given the context of his body and the surrounding terrain.

<h4>3.2 Stability Base Building</h4>

<br><br>
<p class="section">
	I was always a little bothered by the floating trees in Minecraft. Bored one day in lecture, 
	I sketched out an algorithm to prevent "floating islands" with the base building system in 
	Starboard, and eventually made it open source [<a href="https://github.com/kodiakwhale/stability-build-system/">GitHub</a>]. 
	Each component of the structure is treated as a node in a graph, propagating stability updates 
	as pieces are added and removed, using collision detection to calculate edges. This is  
	computed asynchronously across multiple frames in the game to prevent latency spikes.

<h4>3.3 Procedural Generation</h4>
<p class="section">
	Until recently, I was detailing every island in the game by hand, which gave me full creative 
	control but also took a lot of time. I made a tool to automate much of this process, generating 
	an entire resource-filled island from just a rough model and some generation parameters.

<h4>3.4 Water</h4>
<p class="section">
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochoidal_wave">Gerstner waves</a> can be implemented 
	with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">fast Fourier transform</a> 
	to simulate the surface of an ocean in real-time. This relatively straightforward project becomes 
	much more interesting if you want the simulation to be influenced by multiple clients (e.g. the 
	wakes of several boats) and synchronized across the network. I originally used a great open source project 
	called <a href="https://github.com/wave-harmonic/crest">Crest</a>, but I needed my ocean to run 
	on a headless server without a GPU, which isn't possible with Crest. There are no decent open 
	source solutions at the moment, so I'm working on my own.

<h4>4 Voxels</h4>
<p class="section">
	I've always been fascinated by voxels, where scene data is organized on a 3D grid. Having such 
	a pure representation of the world makes so many cool physics & graphics optimizations possible.
</p>

<br>
<h4>4.1 Isosurface Extraction</h4>
<p class="section">
	Given a uniform scalar density field, several algorithms exist to generate an 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosurface">isosurface</a> for it. My undergraduate reserach 
	project explored using these techniques to visualize MRI scans. I similarly applied this knowledge 
	to create a high-resolution real-time sculpting toy. With some clever chunking logic, the isosurface 
	algorithm becomes somewhat naively parallelizable, enabling it to run quite well on a modern laptop 
	without a GPU.

<br>
<h4>5 Future Work</h4>
<p class="section">
	I've started work on parallel physics engine and raytracing prototypes to turn my sculpting 
	toy into a something a little more substantial. Both of these projects benefit dramatically from 
	well structured volumetric data, and the implementation details can look quite different than 
	those of traditional techniques. This work is still in its early stages, but I'm very excited to 
	be working on it for the next few years.
